Hey there! 👋
This repository contains my college assignment project a collection of Star, Number, and Character pattern programs.
I created these patterns while practicing how loops and logic work in programming using C.
Each pattern shows a creative way to use simple code to build shapes like triangles, pyramids, diamonds, and more.
Through this project, I learned how a few lines of logic can turn into amazing visual patterns. ✨
If you’re also learning programming or working on a similar assignment, this repo might be really helpful! 🚀
